# PomoFlexi
 A more flexible way to use the pomodoro method 

## Draft Description and possible roadmap

The basic idea is that the standard pomodoro method is too rigid. It doesn't allow for flexibility in the way YOU work. This app aims to fix that by allowing you to set your own rules and allowing you to change them on the fly.
For example:
- Sometimes you're close to finishing a task but the timer runs out. You can't just stop working on it, so once the timer runs out it starts a new timer tracking the extra time you spent on the task - until you press the continue button, which will stop the timer and add the extra to the base pomodoro, bringing you to your break. The same principle applies to breaks.
- Sometimes you finish a chunk of work before the timer runs out. It may be convinient to start the break earlier, in order to categorize your work and start the next task with a fresh mind. So you can skip directly to the break by pressing the skip button and only the time spent on the task up to that point will be tracked. 
- Sometimes you're working on a task and you get interrupted. So you pause the timer and deal with the interruption, if it's a quick thing you can just resume the timer and continue working. If it's a longer interruption you can stop the timer and start a new one when you're ready to continue working. The time spent on the task up to that point will be tracked and an "interrupted" tag will be added to the task (You could also add extra notes or select one of the suggested options - or choose from your history). This allows you to have a better grasp of your actual workflow, allowing you to better plan your work.

This allows you to work in a more flexible way, while still keeping the benefits of the pomodoro method, whilst also allowing you to track the actual time spent on tasks.
It also allows you to better understand better the way you work, allowing you to set better timers suited to the task at hand - That plus the ability to store different timers for different tasks, makes it simple to start a timer and get more productive.

The app is still in development, so it's not yet ready for use.

There are also plans to categorize tasks and track the time spent on each category, but that's for the future.
There are also plans to use an "unlimited" timer, which will track the time spent on a task until you press the stop button, but that's also for the future.
